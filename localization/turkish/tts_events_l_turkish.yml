## Naval Conference
 # The conference starts
 navalconference.1.t: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('naval_conference_host').GetCapital.GetCityHubName] Naval Conference"
 navalconference.1.d: "Leading naval powers convened in the capital of [SCOPE.sCountry('naval_conference_host').GetCustom('use_the')][SCOPE.sCountry('naval_conference_host').GetName] to discuss a reduction in naval spending. We could propose an [SCOPE.sLawType('extensive_law').GetName] or a [SCOPE.sLawType('moderate_law').GetName]."
 navalconference.1.f: "In a sumptuous hall in the heart of [SCOPE.sCountry('naval_conference_host').GetCapital.GetCityHubName], diplomats from around the world convene to discuss a traty that might shape naval developments for decades to come. Many peace activist groups hope this treaty might be the first in a series of disarmament treaties, with the ultimate goal of completely eliminating war. Some more pragmatic observers, however, dismiss the pacifists' objectives as fanciful dreams, and take the conference as an opportunity to take some of the military budget to something more useful."
 
 navalconference.1.a: "We should push for a large reduction in fleet sizes."
 navalconference.1.b: "We'll suggest a modest reduction."

 navalconference.1.a.tt: "The proposal for [SCOPE.sLawType('extensive_law').GetName] will be sent to all other conference members. They have to accept it for the treaty to take effect. If accepted, it will reduce our navy to approximately #gold half#! of its current strength and prevent it from expanding for five years."
 navalconference.1.b.tt: "The proposal for [SCOPE.sLawType('moderate_law').GetName] will be sent to all other conference members. They have to accept it for the treaty to take effect. If accepted, it will reduce our navy to approximately #gold three-quarters#! of its current strength and prevent it from expanding for five years."

 # Proposal - large
 navalconference.2.t: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('naval_conference_host').GetCapital.GetCityHubName] Naval Conference"
 navalconference.2.d: "Leading naval powers convened in the capital of [SCOPE.sCountry('naval_conference_host').GetCustom('use_the')][SCOPE.sCountry('naval_conference_host').GetName] to discuss a reduction in naval spending. Their delegation proposed an [SCOPE.sLawType('treaty_law').GetName], involving a considerable reduction in fleet sizes amongst all the signatory countries with the intent of keeping budgets under control."
 navalconference.2.f: "In a sumptuous hall in the heart of [SCOPE.sCountry('naval_conference_host').GetCapital.GetCityHubName], diplomats from around the world convene to discuss a traty that might shape naval developments for decades to come. Many peace activist groups hope this treaty might be the first in a series of disarmament treaties, with the ultimate goal of completely eliminating war. Some more pragmatic observers, however, dismiss the pacifists' objectives as fanciful dreams, and take the conference as an opportunity to take some of the military budget to something more useful."

 navalconference.2.a: "We'll follow this new development closely."
 #navalconference.2.a.tt: "We accept the terms of the conference. If all other participants agree, we will enact [SCOPE.sLawType('treaty_law').GetName]. This will reduce our navy to approximately #gold half#! of its current strength and prevent it from expanding for five years."

 # Proposal - small
 navalconference.3.t: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('naval_conference_host').GetCapital.GetCityHubName] Naval Conference"
 navalconference.3.d: "Leading naval powers convened in the capital of [SCOPE.sCountry('naval_conference_host').GetCustom('use_the')][SCOPE.sCountry('naval_conference_host').GetName] to discuss a reduction in naval spending. Their delegation proposed a [SCOPE.sLawType('treaty_law').GetName], involving a reduction in fleet sizes amongst signatory countries."

Some more pragmatic observers, however, dismiss the pacifists' objectives as fanciful dreams, and take the conference as an opportunity to take some of the military budget to something more useful."
 
 navalconference.3.a: "We'll follow this new development closely."
 #navalconference.3.a.tt: "We accept the terms of the conference. If all other participants agree, we will enact [SCOPE.sLawType('treaty_law').GetName]. This will reduce our navy to approximately #gold three-quarters#! of its current strength and prevent it from expanding for five years."
 
 # Treaty success!
 navalconference.4.t: "Success"
 navalconference.4.d: "The nations finally reached an agreement, and the [GetGlobalVariable('naval_conference_state_region').GetStateRegion.GetCityHubName] Naval Treaty will take effect."
 navalconference.4.f: "Today is a historic day. Through diplomacy, several leading powers agreed to reduce their militaries, paving the way to further disarmament measures. Anti-war movements around the world are hopeful that the treaty is a sign that governments are willing to take steps towards world peace.\n\nNot all are as enthusiastic, however. One admiral from the [SCOPE.sCountry('event_navy').GetCustom('name_of_navy')] remarked: "Through the stroke of a pen, more [SCOPE.sCountry('event_navy').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] ships were lost than in any battle in history.""
 navalconference.4.a: "Excellent."

 # Treaty failure
 navalconference.5.t: "Failure"
 navalconference.5.d: "Unfortunately, the parties couldn't reach an agreement. No treaty will be signed."
 navalconference.5.f: "After a year of intense deliberation, the representatives from the nations involved were unable to find a working solution. A [SCOPE.sCountry('rejected_country').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] delegate said the terms were \"unacceptable\", and elaborated: \"The proposals hitherto submitted are an affront to the [SCOPE.sCountry('rejected_country').GetCustom('name_of_navy')]. We will not accept this mockery of a treaty.\""
 navalconference.5.a: "What a waste of time."

 # Treaty results (unused)
 navalconference.6.t: "Naval Conference Results"
 navalconference.6.d: "After intense deliberation by the delegations, it's time to see if they can come to an agreement."
 navalconference.6.f: "TODO"

 navalconference.6.a: "And the results are..."
 navalconference.6.a.tt: "We'll see if the parties agreed with the treaty"

 # Accepting the Treaty
 navalconference.8.t: "Accepting the Treaty"
 navalconference.8.d: "Should we accept the terms of the [GetGlobalVariable('naval_conference_state_region').GetStateRegion.GetCityHubName] Naval Conference, in favor of the [GetGlobalVariable('treaty_law_var').GetLawType.GetName]?"
 navalconference.8.a: "Yes, we agree."
 navalconference.8.a.tt: "We agree to the terms of the Treaty. It will only be put in effect if all parties agree.\nWARNING: This vote cannot be undone."
 navalconference.8.b: "On second thought, let's analyze it more carefully..."

 # Convincing the others to join
 navalconference.9.t: "Persuasive Arguments"
 navalconference.9.d: "What should we do to persuade [SCOPE.sC('persuaded_country').GetCustom('use_the')][SCOPE.sC('persuaded_country').GetName] to agree to the Treaty?"
 navalconference.9.f: ""We're interested in assuring world peace and prosperity. However, some other countries do not realize the value of our cause and might need some additional incentives.""
 navalconference.9.a: "Offer them an obligation."
 navalconference.9.a.tt: "We will promise them an [concept_obligation]. They will only receive it after the treaty gets approved."
 navalconference.9.b: "Call in their obligation they owe to us."
 navalconference.9.b.tt: "We will promise to forgive the [concept_obligation] they owe to use. It will only be absolved after the treaty gets approved."
 navalconference.9.c: "Nothing some money can't solve."
 navalconference.9.c.tt: "We will bribe them with #GOLD 500 thousand pounds#!, paid over 50 weeks. We will only give them after the treaty gets approved."

 # Receiving an offer for an obligation
 navalconference.10.t: "An Offer is Made"
 navalconference.10.d: "[SCOPE.sC('persuaded_country').GetCustom('use_the')|U][SCOPE.sC('persuaded_country').GetName] has offered us an [concept_obligation] if we agree to vote in favor of the [GetGlobalVariable('treaty_law_var').GetLawType.GetName]."
 navalconference.10.f: ""If you accept to work with us in this treaty, we might reward you in the future.""
 navalconference.10.a: "We accept their offer."
 navalconference.10.a.tt: "We will vote in favor of the treaty. The [concept_obligation] will only be given if the treaty gets approved."
 navalconference.10.b: "We're not convinced."

 navalconference.11.d: "[SCOPE.sC('host_country').GetCustom('use_the')|U][SCOPE.sC('host_country').GetName] is willing to forgive the [concept_obligation] we have to them if we agree to vote in favor of the [GetGlobalVariable('treaty_law_var').GetLawType.GetName]."
 navalconference.11.f: ""We have helped you in the past, it's only natural that you return the favor.""
 navalconference.11.a: "A fair deal."
 navalconference.11.a.tt: "We will vote in favor of the treaty. The [concept_obligation] will only be forgiven if the treaty gets approved."
 navalconference.11.b: "We'll leave it for another time."

 # Receiving an offer for a bribe
 navalconference.12.t: "A Simple Solution"
 navalconference.12.d: "[SCOPE.sC('host_country').GetAdjective] officials have been attempting to bribe some of our politicians to vote in favor of the [GetGlobalVariable('treaty_law_var').GetLawType.GetName]."
 navalconference.12.f: "Some suspiciously large donations have been received by our representatives at the [GetGlobalVariable('naval_conference_state_region').GetStateRegion.GetCityHubName] Naval Conference, and we suspect there is more to come."
 navalconference.12.a: "No harm in taking a little money."
 navalconference.12.a.tt: "We will vote in favor of the treaty. [SCOPE.sC('host_country').GetCustom('use_the')|U][SCOPE.sC('host_country').GetName] will give us #GOLD 500 thousand pounds#! if the treaty gets approved."
 navalconference.12.b: "Our politicians are incorruptible."

 # They accepted our offer
 navalconference.13.t: "Offer Accepted"
 navalconference.13.d: "[SCOPE.sC('persuaded_country').GetCustom('use_the')|U][SCOPE.sC('persuaded_country').GetName] accepted our offer, and will be supporting the treaty."
 navalconference.13.a: "Excellent."

 # They rejected our offer
 navalconference.14.t: "Offer Declined"
 navalconference.14.d: "[SCOPE.sC('persuaded_country').GetCustom('use_the')|U][SCOPE.sC('persuaded_country').GetName] rejected our generous offer, and hasn't agreed to backing the treaty yet."
 navalconference.14.a: "We'll find another way to convince them."


## Cordite
 # Relax safety procedures
 cordite.1.t: "Review Safety Procedures?"
 cordite.1.d: "After years of using [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCustom('powder_name')], some officers believe we could achive a higher fire by relaxing a few of our ammunition reloading procedures, as the new propellants are supposedly safer to handle. However, there's a risk that those explosives are not as safe as we thought."
 cordite.1.f: "This new propellant, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCustom('powder_name')], is a lot better than the black powder we used to have. It produces less smoke, leaves less residue and is much less volatile, making it safer to use onboard ships. We could take advantage of the added safety by optimizing the reloading procedures, and removing some of the precautions, to increase the rate of fire of our ships and therefore gain some extra firepower."

 cordite.1.a: "We need all the firepower we can get."
 cordite.1.a.tt: "This might have negative consequences."
 cordite.1.b: "No need to take unnecessary risks."

 # Ship Explosion
 cordite.2.t: "Losses at Sea"
 cordite.2.d: "During a recent naval battle, a number of our ships succumbed to magazine detonations, possibly as a result of unsafe ammunition handling."
 cordite.2.f: "The detonations caused massive explosions onboard the ships, sending thick clouds of smoke, flame and debris billowing into the sky. The explosions were so powerful they could be heard from miles away as the ships were reduced to piles of burning wreckage.\n\nAs he watched the inferno unfold from afar, the admiral only had the energy to muster a few words:\n\n"There's something wrong with our bloody ships today!""
 cordite.2.a: "A regrettable loss."
 cordite.2.a.tt: "Your naval battles will have the [GetBattleCondition('battle_condition_exploding_ships').GetName] battle condition for as long as the modifier is active"

 # Ship explodes during peacetime
 cordite.3.t: "Battleship Explodes"
 cordite.3.d: "One of our battleships seems to have suffered a catastrophic magazine detonation, while performing routine patrols. The explosion destroyed the ship, killing dozens of sailors."
 cordite.3.f: "TODO"
 cordite.3.a: "Maybe our explosives are not as safe as we thought."
 cordite.3.b: "There's nothing we can do about it."
 cordite.3.c: "That's an act of sabotage by [SCOPE.sCountry('scapegoat_country').GetCustom('use_the')][SCOPE.sCountry('scapegoat_country').GetName]! To war!"

# Cheating the Naval Treaties
 cheating_treaty.1.t: "Circumventing the Treaties"
 cheating_treaty.1.d: "Through creative accounting, deceptive nomenclature, and straight lies, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCustom('name_of_navy')] managed to build up its forces in a way that exceeds the limit stipulated by Naval Treaties."
 cheating_treaty.1.f: ""No matter what inspectors say, those cruisers are definitely under 10,000 tons. Also, this ship is too small to be considered an aircraft carrier, it's merely an escort vessel. And this water storage is for feeding the boilers, it shouldn't count towards our displacement...""
 cheating_treaty.1.a: "I see nothing wrong here."

# The Great Eastern
 greateastern.1.t: "The Great Eastern"
 greateastern.1.d: "Isambard Kingdom Brunel's latest ship, the Great Eastern, is finally complete. The giant vessel is considered a marvel of engineering. However, there's a concern that the behemoth might have difficulties making a profit."
 greateastern.1.f: "Weighing over 30,000 tons fully loaded, the iron giant is six times larger than any other ship in the world. The mixed propulsion system of sails, paddles and screws is designed for a speed of 14 knots, offering a relatively fast transatlantic crossing."
 greateastern.1.a: "Let's give it some financial support, this ship is the pride of Britain."
 greateastern.1.b: "At least she might be useful for laying telegraph cables."
 greateastern.1.c: "Brunel's vision might serve us well in parliament."
 greateastern.1.e: "The ship is nothing more than a passing curiosity."

# The Two Power Standard
 twopowerstandard.1.t: "The Two-Power Standard"
 twopowerstandard.1.d: "As an island nation, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCustom('use_the')][ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has always been dependent on its navy for trade and defense. Some have proposed formalizing our need for naval supremacy in the form of the #GOLD Two-Power Standard#!, where we'd commit to having a larger navy than the next two powers combined."
 twopowerstandard.1.f: ""Our supremacy on the sea must, after all, be measured by the number of battleships we can put into line. As we find other nations pushing forward this particular class of shis, it is further our duty to do the same.\n\nI think I am accurate in saying that our establishment should be on such a scale that it equals the strength of any two other Countries.""
 twopowerstandard.1.a: "Maintaining naval supremacy is paramount."
 twopowerstandard.1.a.tt: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('navy_ig').GetName] will get an opinion modifier depending on our adherence to the standard"
 twopowerstandard.1.b: "We can't afford to maintain such a large fleet."

## Tech Events
 # Innovative Admiral
 tts_tech_events.1.t: "Admiral Promotes Innovations in the Navy"
 tts_tech_events.1.d: "One of our admirals, [SCOPE.sCharacter('innovative_admiral').GetFullName], has been instrumental in the development of Dreadnought battleships, and is also promoting other innovative ideas in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCustom('name_of_navy')]."
 tts_tech_events.1.f: "Nothing escapes Admiral [SCOPE.sCharacter('innovative_admiral').GetLastNameNoFormatting]'s eye. Battleships, escorts, torpedoes, everything is being modernized under his supervision."
 tts_tech_events.1.a: "Excellent."
 tts_tech_events.1.b: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('innovative_admiral').GetLastName]'s innovations have made him a public figure."

 # Note: tts_tech_events.2 is a hidden event

 # Open hearth process gives advantage to the navy
 tts_tech_events.3.t: "Partners in the Industry"
 tts_tech_events.3.d: "The [SCOPE.sBuilding('steel_mill_scope').GetName] in [SCOPE.sState('industrial_state').GetName] are a major supplier of steel for our navy, and the quality of their steel has allowed us to improve the design of our ships."
 tts_tech_events.3.f: "Beneath the smoggy skies of [SCOPE.sState('industrial_state').GetCityHubName], steel mills are hard at work to fill the needs of the navy. The new compound armor promises to offer much more protection per inch than previous iron-based armor, while the the steel structure of the hull is lightweight and sturdy."
 tts_tech_events.3.a: "Our industry is our strength."

 # Predreadnought Research Finished
 tts_tech_events.4.t: "Research Finished!"
 tts_tech_events.4.d: "Our research is concluded. We can now build Steel Battleships."
 tts_tech_events.4.f: "Many technological innovations have allowed us to develop a new generation of warships. The old wrought iron has been replaced by compound armor. Black powder has been replaced by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCustom('powder_name')]. Rotating turrets are now commonplace.\n\nNaval design advances faster than ever before, and we must keep up with the new developments."
 tts_tech_events.4.a: "Excellent."

 # Dreadnought Research Finished
 tts_tech_events.5.t: "Research Finished!"
 tts_tech_events.5.d: "Our research is concluded. We can now build Dreadnought Battleships."
 tts_tech_events.5.f: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCustom('first_dreadnought_name')] is being launched today, and with it a new age dawns for our navy. It incorporates the most recent innovations, including a central rangefinder and fire control, allowing it to engage targets accurately at longer ranges, and a turbine-powered propulsion system, which allows it to outrun and outmaneuver previous ships."
 tts_tech_events.5.a: "We are entering a new era of warfare."

 # Battleship research finished
 tts_tech_events.6.t: "Research Finished!"
 tts_tech_events.6.d: "Our research is concluded. We can now build Battleships more efficiently."
 tts_tech_events.6.f: "Yesterday, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] went to [SCOPE.sState('port_state').GetPortHubName] to inspect the new battleships being built. The scope of the shipyard operations is truly amazing. On the shore, partially constructed ships are lined up in their drydock berths, while a swarm of workers weld parts together and install fittings. A giant crane lifts an entire pre-made section of a ship to be assembled. After it's done, it's tasked with moving a set of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCustom('superdreadnought_caliber')] guns - the largest ever put on [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] ships. \"So far,\" a shipwright remarks; there are already plans for fitting even bigger guns.\n\nThe head of state left the inspection satisfied, knowing that the future is bright for our navy."
 tts_tech_events.6.a: "Our ships shall rule the waves."

 # Civilian shipyards help dreadnought research
 tts_tech_events.7.t: "Shipyard Innovations"
 tts_tech_events.7.d: "The [SCOPE.sBuilding('shipyard_building').GetName] at [SCOPE.sState('shipyard_state').GetName] are using their expertise in shipbuilding to help our development of Dreadnought Battleships."
 tts_tech_events.7.f: "[SCOPE.sState('shipyard_state').GetPortHubName] is a city with a maritime vocation. From its shipyards, come yachts, steamers, and ocean liners of worldwide renown. But its engineers and mechanics are working on designing a new generation of battleships, larger, faster and more heavily armed than ever before. Certainly, such a task would be more difficult if we didn't have a large body of experienced workers to draw from."
 tts_tech_events.7.a: "Keep it up."

 # Civilian shipyards help battleship research
 tts_tech_events.8.t: "Ship Mass Production"
 tts_tech_events.8.d: "The [SCOPE.sBuilding('shipyard_building').GetName] at [SCOPE.sState('shipyard_state').GetName] are using their expertise in shipbuilding to help our development of Super-Dreadnought Battleships."
 tts_tech_events.8.f: "The shipyard installations at [SCOPE.sState('shipyard_state').GetPortHubName] are some of the most extensive in the world. Row upon row of drydocks, each of them filled with ships in various stages of construction. Mass production on this scale will prove ever more necessary in the years to come, since larger and more complex ships will require a lot of man-hours to build, so parallel construction will be necessary if we are to maintain a steady flow of battleships into our navy. Luckily, our strong shipbuilding industry should be up to the task."
 tts_tech_events.8.a: "Excellent."

 # Large scale steelmaking benefits navy
 tts_tech_events.9.t: "Steel Mass Production"
 tts_tech_events.9.d: "The [SCOPE.sBuilding('steel_mill_scope').GetName] in [SCOPE.sState('industrial_state').GetName] are producing steel very efficiently, allowing us to increase the armor quality of our ships."
 tts_tech_events.9.f: "The steelmaking industry of [SCOPE.sState('industrial_state').GetCityHubName] is a true colossus of engineering. Few industrial complexes in the world can compare to the scale of its ironworks. The vast steel production capacity allows the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCustom('name_of_navy')] to afford better protection on its ships, by increasing both armor quality and coverage."
 tts_tech_events.9.a: "Our industry is our strength."

 # Convert a battleship to an aircraft carrier
 tts_tech_events.10.t: "Convert One of Our Ships?"
 tts_tech_events.10.d: "The large hull of one of our capital ships would make a good testbed for carrier development."
 tts_tech_events.10.f: "As the result of a viability study conducted by the navy, our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCustom('converted_carrier_name')] would be the ideal vessel for conversion to aircraft carrier. Its superstructure will be razed, and converted to a flight deck. Having a large aircraft carrier will be fundamental in training pilots and developing our carrier doctrine."
 tts_tech_events.10.a: "An excellent idea."
 tts_tech_events.10.a.tt: "This will accelerate our development of Fleet Carriers by a year."
 tts_tech_events.10.b: "We can't afford to weaken our battle line."

 # Convert a battleship to an aircraft carrier
 tts_tech_events.11.t: "Ship Converted to Carrier"
 tts_tech_events.11.d: "As a result of the Naval Treaties we've signed, a lot of capital ships were scrapped, but they also allow us to convert one of the ships under construction into a carrier."
 tts_tech_events.11.d_treaty_name: "As a result of the #WHITE [GetGlobalVariable('naval_conference_state_region').GetStateRegion.GetCityHubName] Naval Treaty#!, a lot of capital ships were scrapped, but it also allowed us to convert one of the ships under construction into a carrier."
 tts_tech_events.11.f: "According to a viability study conducted by the navy, our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCustom('converted_carrier_name')] would be the ideal vessel for conversion to aircraft carrier. Its superstructure will be razed, and converted to a flight deck. Having a large aircraft carrier will be fundamental in training pilots and developing our carrier doctrine."
 tts_tech_events.11.a: "At least we'll get something out of this."
 tts_tech_events.11.a.tt: "This will accelerate our development of Fleet Carriers by a year."

 # Convert an ocean liner to a carrier
 tts_tech_events.12.t: "Liners to Carriers"
 tts_tech_events.12.d: "An ocean liner, with its large, long hull and relatively high speed, would be a good candidate for conversion into an aircraft carrier."
 tts_tech_events.12.f: "To aid in our carrier program, the Admiralty has proposed that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCustom('converted_liner_name')]. It will be purchased from its previous owner and go through a rebuild process, so that it can be used in our Navy for testing."
 tts_tech_events.12.a: "We need as many hulls as we can get."
 tts_tech_events.12.a.tt: "This will accelerate our development of Fleet Carriers by a year."
 tts_tech_events.12.b: "We can't afford it."

 # Development of Dive Bombers
 tts_tech_events.13.t: "Development of Dive Bombers"
 tts_tech_events.13.d: "The [SCOPE.sBuilding('aircraft_building').GetName] at [SCOPE.sState('aircraft_state').GetName] have perfected carrier-borne Dive Bombers, allowing them to strike targets at sea with precision."
 tts_tech_events.13.f: "It was a calm day at the Navy aircraft test field. Over the blue sky backdrop, between the few scattered clouds, a small dot could be seen. It was the new Dive Bomber prototype, ready to be evaluated. As it got close to the designated area, the skilled pilot pulled on the stick, sending the aircraft on a dive. He performed a simulated bombing run, dropping a dummy payload square in the target. The spectators seemed pleased with the result. Among them, there were generals, admirals, representatives of the government and the contracted companies. After this successful test, the new aircraft model was one step closer to being put in mass production."
 tts_tech_events.13.a: "What will they come up with next?"
 tts_tech_events.13.a.tt: "This will accelerate our development of Fleet Carriers by a year."

 # Development of Monoplane Fighters
 tts_tech_events.14.t: "One Wing is Better than Two"
 tts_tech_events.14.d: "Onboard an Aircraft Carrier, the first test flight of a monoplane fighter was performed today."
 tts_tech_events.14.f: "Tensions were high in the control tower of the carrier#WHITE [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCustom('carrier_name')]#!. Several officers were crammed inside, waiting for the test flight. On the deck, rested the prototype [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCustom('first_monoplane_fighter')], making its final preparations. A crewmember signals a takeoff clearance, and the fighter zips down the runway, up to the end of the flight deck. The suspense mounts as the plane dips below the deck, threatening to crash into the sea, but it manages to gain altitude and fly away, to the cheers of all the officers watching."
 tts_tech_events.14.a: "This is surely the future of aviation!"
 tts_tech_events.14.a.tt: "This will accelerate our development of Fleet Carriers by a year."

 # Development of Homing Beacons
 tts_tech_events.15.t: "Finding Our Directions"
 tts_tech_events.15.d: "The [SCOPE.sBuilding('radio_building').GetName] at [SCOPE.sS('radio_state').GetName] have developed Homing Beacons to help carrier aircraft find their way to the ship."
 tts_tech_events.15.f: "The beacon installed on the carrier sends a directional radio pulse on a predetermined pattern. By synchronizing their clocks, the aircraft can determine the direction to the carrier based on the timing of the pulses. If the directional pulse was calibrated to pass through the North at the beginning of each minute, then the pilot could know the carrier was on the opposite direction of the seconds hand on his watch, when he heard the signal.\n\nThis system can be used to help single-seat fighters to easily find a carrier to land on after a mission."
 tts_tech_events.15.a: "Like a pigeon."
 tts_tech_events.15.a.tt: "This will accelerate our development of Fleet Carriers by 6 months."

 # Research Finished
 tts_tech_events.16.t: "Research Finished!"
 tts_tech_events.16.d: "We have developed more capable aircraft and aircraft carriers. Now we should decide on what we should focus on next."
 tts_tech_events.16.a: "We need to get as many aircraft as we can in our carriers."
 tts_tech_events.16.a.tt: "This will unlock [GetCombatUnitType('combat_unit_type_fleet_carrier').GetName] in our naval bases. They have more attack power than Armored Carriers, but they have slightly increased chance of getting a negative [concept_battle_condition] during battles.\n#YELLOW Warning:#! This choice is permanent and cannot be undone."
 tts_tech_events.16.b: "Focus on protecting our carriers. They need armored flight decks."
 tts_tech_events.16.b.tt: "This will unlock [GetCombatUnitType('combat_unit_type_armored_carrier').GetName] in our naval bases. They have a bonus to morale loss and have less chance of getting a negative [concept_battle_condition] during battles, but they have less attack power than Strike Carriers.\n#YELLOW Warning:#! This choice is permanent and cannot be undone."

 # Researched Unarmored (Strike) Carriers
 tts_tech_events.17.t: "Floating Airstrips"
 tts_tech_events.17.d: "Our newest carriers are being commissioned. With the lessons learned in the past few years, our seaborne aircraft operations should be much more effective now."
 tts_tech_events.17.f: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCustom('political_head_of_navy')] went to [SCOPE.sS('carrier_state').GetPortHubName] for the commissioning ceremony. In his speech, he emphasized the importance of our carriers to project power abroad, and that a large airgroup with powerful aircraft is fundamental in fulfiling that role."
 tts_tech_events.17.a: "We shall conquer the skies."

 # Researched Armored Carriers
 tts_tech_events.18.t: "Floating Bastions"
 tts_tech_events.18.d: "Our newest carriers are being commissioned. With the lessons learned in the past few years, our carriers should be more survivable while still retaining considerable airpower."
 tts_tech_events.18.f: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCustom('political_head_of_navy')] went to [SCOPE.sS('carrier_state').GetPortHubName] for the commissioning ceremony. In his speech, he emphasized the importance of protecting our valuable carriers, as the ability to strike back at the enemy can be vital."

 fleet_review_events.1.d: "Before the Fleet Review starts, we need to decide how much we're willing to spend."
 fleet_review_events.1.a: "Spare no expenses."
 fleet_review_events.1.b: "Spend enough to make a good display."
 fleet_review_events.1.c: "As little as possible. The navy already has their own funding."

 # Choosing a special guest
 fleet_review_events.2.t: "Our Guest of Honor"
 fleet_review_events.2.d: "We could use the fleet review as an opportunity to pay homage to a special guest. Who should we choose?"
 fleet_review_events.2.a: "[SCOPE.sC('friendly_nation_1').GetCustom('use_the')|U][SCOPE.sC('friendly_nation_1').GetName] would make a good guest."
 fleet_review_events.2.a.tt: "Our relations with [SCOPE.sC('friendly_nation_1').GetCustom('use_the')][SCOPE.sC('friendly_nation_1').GetName] will change depending on the results."
 fleet_review_events.2.b: "[SCOPE.sC('friendly_nation_2').GetCustom('use_the')|U][SCOPE.sC('friendly_nation_2').GetName] is our greatest friend."
 fleet_review_events.2.b.tt: "Our relations with [SCOPE.sC('friendly_nation_2').GetCustom('use_the')][SCOPE.sC('friendly_nation_2').GetName] will change depending on the results."
 fleet_review_events.2.c: "Homage? The purpose of the display is to show the [SCOPE.sC('rival_country').GetAdjective] who's best!"
 fleet_review_events.2.c.tt: "Our Navy [concept_power_projection] will change depending on the results."

 # Fleet review starts (navy tech level)
 fleet_review_events.3.t: "The Review Begins"
 fleet_review_events.3.d_intro: "The Fleet Review has started, and our ships attract the attention of the crowd."
 fleet_review_events.3.d_impressive: "They are at the very cutting edge of naval technology."
 fleet_review_events.3.d_middle: "They are amongst the most advanced in the world."
 fleet_review_events.3.d_disappointing: "However, they are quite old, and not very impressive."
 fleet_review_events.3.f_intro: "The ships approach in two columns, as the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] watches from an elevated platform. Next to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim] there are other officials and foreign dignataries, including a [SCOPE.sC('guest_country').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] delegation.\n\nLeading the parade is the flagship#WHITE [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCustom('custom_flagship_name')]#!, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCustom('review_flagship_type')]\n\n"
 fleet_review_events.3.f_impressive_friend: "The ship is one of the newest and most powerful in the world, and our guests and the general public are very impressed."
 fleet_review_events.3.f_middle_friend: "That is a modern and well-equipped ship, and the public seems to be pleased with the display."
 fleet_review_events.3.f_disappointing_friend: "Unfortunately, it's not a very modern ship, and some people in the crowd seem disappointed at the obsolete state of our navy."
 fleet_review_events.3.f_impressive_rival: "The ship is one of the newest and most powerful in the world, and even the [SCOPE.sC('guest_country').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] guests were impressed by its might."
 fleet_review_events.3.f_middle_rival: "The ship was relatively modern and in decent condition, but that didn't seem to impress our [SCOPE.sC('guest_country').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] guests. \"I've seen better,\" they claim."
 fleet_review_events.3.f_disappointing_rival: "The ship is not particularly modern, and some barely-disguised scoffs could be heard from the [SCOPE.sC('guest_country').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] side as it passed."
 fleet_review_events.3.a: "We are the vanguard of innovation."
 fleet_review_events.3.b: "We must not be complacent."
 fleet_review_events.3.c: "That's fine, technology isn't everything..."
 
 # Fleet Review: Navy Professionalism
 fleet_review_events.4.t: "Fleet Review: Our Crews"
 fleet_review_events.4.d_high: "During the Fleet Review, our ships' crews have shown remarkable skill."
 fleet_review_events.4.d_medium: "During the Fleet Review, our ships' crews have performed decently well."
 fleet_review_events.4.d_low: "During the Fleet Review, our ship's crews have displayed a quite poor performance."
 fleet_review_events.4.f_high: "The ships maintain the formation perfectly. As each ship's crew salutes the audience from the decks, you can feel they're proud of their work."
 fleet_review_events.4.f_medium: "The ships sail in formation, as the crowd watches. They performed their duties well, albeit with a few minor issues along the ceremony."
 fleet_review_events.4.f_low: "The review almost ended in disaster when one of the ships went off-course, nearly colliding with the other column. Many other ships can't maintain formation properly. It's clear that the training is quite lacking in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCustom('name_of_navy')]."
 fleet_review_events.4.a: "We salute our brave sailors."
 fleet_review_events.4.b: "They're doing a fine job."
 fleet_review_events.4.c: "They'll have a meeting with the cat-o'-nine-tails later..."
 
 # Fleet Review: Fleet size
 fleet_review_events.5.t: "Fleet Review: The Size of Our Fleet"
 fleet_review_events.5.d_best: "Our fleet is the largest in the world, and it makes our Review much more impressive."
 fleet_review_events.5.d_good: "Our fleet is quite large, and the Review is a display of our power."
 fleet_review_events.5.d_medium: "Our fleet is not that large, but it can still make a good display."
 fleet_review_events.5.d_small: "Our fleet is tiny, which makes the Review a little underwhelming."
 fleet_review_events.5.f_best: "The Review goes on for a long time, which is natural given the size of our fleet. Row upon row of warships go past our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle], seemingly without end. After witnessing such a sight, there's no doubt in anyone's mind about the might of our fleet."
 fleet_review_events.5.f_good: "The Review includes several rows of warships of different sizes. Although our fleet is not the biggest in the world, it's certainly not to be messed with."
 fleet_review_events.5.f_medium: "The Review goes on for a while, but it's pretty clear that our fleet isn't really one of the largest. As a moderately-sized navy, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCustom('name_of_navy')] has just enough ships to be an active fighting force, but not enough to be a major player in the global stage."
 fleet_review_events.5.f_small: "The Review ends quite shortly after it begins, disappointing some spectators. It's clear that the size of our navy is not something worth bragging about."
 fleet_review_events.5.f_rival: "Some [SCOPE.sC('guest_country').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] guests laugh at the state of our fleet."
 fleet_review_events.5.a: "Nothing can beat our navy!"
 fleet_review_events.5.b: "Other nations fear our navy."
 fleet_review_events.5.c: "A respectable display."
 fleet_review_events.5.e: "It's not about the size of the navy, it's how you use it!"

 # The end of the fleet review
 fleet_review_events.6.t: "The End of the Review"
 fleet_review_events.6.d_good: "The Fleet Review is over, and it can be considered a great success. Our fleet performed spectacularly."
 fleet_review_events.6.d_medium: "The Fleet Review is over, and the overall result can be considered good."
 fleet_review_events.6.d_bad: "The Fleet Review is over, and the results were not good. Our navy's reputation was tarnished as a result."
 fleet_review_events.6.f_good: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] could not have been more satisfied. It's clear that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] navy was ready to take on any opponent. The crowd cheered, ecstatic, as the last few ships sailed by, flying a large [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] naval ensign on their afts. As the flags disappeared over the horizon, the Review came to a close, but some enthusiastic voices could still be heard from the audience."
 fleet_review_events.6.f_medium: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] watched as the last few ships sailed by. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe|U] was pleased by the result. It was not the most spectacular display in the world, but it showed that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCustom('name_of_navy')] was a capable fighting force."
 fleet_review_events.6.f_bad: "The Review could only be described as a disaster. After many misfortunes and embarrassments, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCustom('name_of_navy')] became the laughing stock of the world."
 fleet_review_events.6.a: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCustom('name_of_navy')] is the best in the world!"
 fleet_review_events.6.b: "An acceptable result."
 fleet_review_events.6.c: "A shameful display."

 admiralty.3.a: "Put some guarantees to soothe their nerves."
 admiralty.3.a.tt: "This will set back the Admiralty reform by 3 months."
 admiralty.3.b: "The Admiralty is more important."
